E-SHOP CYPRUS FOOD MUSEUM

As a part of our semester project the following github repository contains all the important information about the new E-shop website we design for the Cyprus food museum. Cyprus food museum is a new organization which aims to support the Cyprus' traditional food.

The organization will be able to sell its products, giving discounts and coupons for cypriot reastaurants, to the cypriot community through this eshop.
The user has the ability to search in organization's catalogues using keywords related to the product (such as: name, category, description, ingredients) to find products.

Target Users:

1. Simple User - This user can search for products, see the advertisements about books or restaurant, read recipes of cypriot foods

2. Member User - This user has his/her profile with personal information and his/her cart for future orders, can see an adaptive home page to his/her interests (based on his/her previous orders or product views). Member user has also the ability to order products and print coupons for free and view the history of his/her orders.

3. Administrator User - This user has the ability to change the content of the eshop. Administrator is able to add/edit/delete products, product categories, coupons, special offers, recipes, users. He/She can change the content of the home page  and process the current orders.
